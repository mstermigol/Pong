# Programming rules

1. Only use english, both in code as in the commit messages (done since Oct 1 :) ).
2. The filenames will be in lower case and without blank spaces ex. `server.c` o `myhead.h`.
3. The method names will be in PascalCase ex `ClientThreads`.
4. The variable names will be in camelCase ex `clientSocket`.
5. The constants will be in UPPERCASE and in Snake_Case ex `MAX_CLIENTS`.
6. The commits structure is `Verb` + `the thing you did` ex. `Updated programming rules`
